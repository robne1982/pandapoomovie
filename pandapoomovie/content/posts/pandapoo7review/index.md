It was the hottest ticket in town, and the bustling North Yorkshire streets were alive with the low murmur of movie-world importance. Glasses clinked with carefully mixed whisky, gin, and lemon as the audience assembled. Afterwards, we gathered to discuss Panda Poo’s place in cinema history, debating earnestly whether this small, scheming panda might reshape the industry entirely. The discussion lasted well into the night, growing only more serious as the drinks ran out.

Reviews are in, and it looks like the team behind Panda Poo 7 have another blockbuster hit to keep them in mocktails through 2026.




### 📰 *The Friendly Flicker*  
**Oliver Pennypack**

> “Made with visible joy and an abundance of glue, *Panda Poo 7* is a reminder that cinema doesn’t need polish to have heart. Panda Poo’s attempts to find love are earnest, ridiculous, and doomed — and the film treats both his optimism and his failure with kindness.”

---

### 🎥 *Junior Animator Quarterly*  
**Lila Fernandez (Age 12½)**

> “Panda Poo lies a lot but he’s really bad at it, which makes it funny instead of mean. The girl pandas always know what he’s doing and don’t fall for it, which I liked because they’re smarter than him. Also the explosions are made of paper and you can tell.”

### 🍿 *The Saturday Matinee Review*  
**Gordon Bellows**

> “There’s something wonderfully innocent about *Panda Poo 7*. It understands that the joke isn’t on love, but on Panda Poo’s belief that he can shortcut his way to it. He can’t — and the film gently laughs along with him, never at him.”

---

### 🧠 *Small Hands, Big Ideas*  
**Dr. Amrita Shah**

> “Created by children, *Panda Poo 7* carries a sincerity that no adult studio could manufacture. The female characters are patient, perceptive, and entirely unmoved by Panda Poo’s antics, delivering a quietly excellent lesson: affection can’t be tricked into existence.”

---

### 🎞️ *Frame by Frame Fun*  
**Reggie Mull**

> “Every wobble in the animation feels like a signature. *Panda Poo 7* leans into its handmade nature, with bold storytelling choices and characters who clearly understand more than the panda at the center of it all. It’s sweet, silly, and surprisingly wise.”

---

### 🧸 *The Kind Critic*  
**Maribel Stone**

> “Panda Poo may lie, cheat, and scheme in the name of love, but the film never rewards him for it — and that’s what makes it so charming. The joy comes from watching him try, fail, and try again, surrounded by characters who see him clearly and care anyway.”
