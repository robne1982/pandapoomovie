Panda Poo’s attempts to find love are earnest, ridiculous, and doomed — and the film treats both his optimism and his failure with kindness.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=-junior-animator-quarterly>🎥 <em>Junior Animator Quarterly</em></h3><p><strong>Lila Fernandez (Age 12½)</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Panda Poo lies a lot but he’s really bad at it, which makes it funny instead of mean. The girl pandas always know what he’s doing and don’t fall for it, which I liked because they’re smarter than him. Also the explosions are made of paper and you can tell.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=-the-saturday-matinee-review>🍿 <em>The Saturday Matinee Review</em></h3><p><strong>Gordon Bellows</strong></p><blockquote><p>“There’s something wonderfully innocent about <em>Panda Poo 7</em>. It understands that the joke isn’t on love, but on Panda Poo’s belief that he can shortcut his way to it. He can’t — and the film gently laughs along with him, never at him.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=-small-hands-big-ideas>🧠 <em>Small Hands, Big Ideas</em></h3><p><strong>Dr. Amrita Shah</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Created by children, <em>Panda Poo 7</em> carries a sincerity that no adult studio could manufacture. The female characters are patient, perceptive, and entirely unmoved by Panda Poo’s antics, delivering a quietly excellent lesson: affection can’t be tricked into existence.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=-frame-by-frame-fun>🎞️ <em>Frame by Frame Fun</em></h3><p><strong>Reggie Mull</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Every wobble in the animation feels like a signature. <em>Panda Poo 7</em> leans into its handmade nature, with bold storytelling choices and characters who clearly understand more than the panda at the center of it all. It’s sweet, silly, and surprisingly wise.”</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id=-the-kind-critic>🧸 <em>The Kind Critic</em></h3><p><strong>Maribel Stone</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Panda Poo may lie, cheat, and scheme in the name of love, but the film never rewards him for it — and that’s what makes it so charming. The joy comes from watching him try, fail, and try again, surrounded by characters who see him clearly and care anyway.”</p></blockquote><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://robne1982.github.io/pandapoomovie/>&copy; Panda Poo - The Movies 2026</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
